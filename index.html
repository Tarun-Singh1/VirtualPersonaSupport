                <h3 class="fs-2">Truth 1</h3>
                <p>It's not just about giving virtual personalities to AI models. It's about making them more human-like. Just as humans have 16 personalities, Virtual Persona also offers 16 personalities for AI models. The reason behind giving them an identity is to make AI more interactive, strengthening the bond between humans and AI and making it friendlier.</p>

                </div>
                <h3 class="fs-2">Truth 2</h3>
                <p>The reason for using AI anime models is that nobody likes the 3D models presented in the metaverse. These days, 3D models are neither completely realistic nor visually appealing. However, 2D models are easier to create, more visually appealing, and easier to animate and add effects to. So, it is a much better idea to use these types of models instead of realistic ones.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature col">
                <div class="feature-icon d-inline-flex align-items-center justify-content-center fs-2 mb-3">

                </div>
                <h3 class="fs-2">Truth 3</h3>
                <p>The answer is that they are not designed this way. Virtual Persona's main use is to make you more time-efficient, set reminders, timers, create daily plans, chat with you, and track your progress at the end of the day. These assistants don't do that for you. Maybe other tools can, but I don't think manually managing everything is an efficient way. This can save your precious time.

              <p>Of course, you can, but how efficient is it? You can create a To-Do list on a sticky note. What if something unexpected happens and you need to change it completely? Then you have to create a new one. Next, you have to tick off tasks whenever you finish them. What if you forget? Not everyone is full of consistency and discipline. At the end of the day, after finishing all of your tasks, you don't have a dashboard to keep track of your progress and analyze your successes and failures. Also, you won't spend your time doing all of this manually on different websites!</p>

              <p>Fine, then it's not for you. However, almost everyone uses a computer these days, whether you are a student, professor, programmer, content creator, and so on. We use computers, and if there is a virtual assistant to make your life easier, why not use it? It will only benefit you. In the future, AI will be very useful and influence every department of work, so this can be a great way to stay updated with innovative advancements. This AI assistant is mainly for computer users because these AI models are not going to fit on your mobile screen, and it can create screen hindrance. Also, mobile phones are full of distractions. Nobody uses a mobile phone to study or work for long periods.</p>

              <h3 class="fs-2">Explanation 3</h3>
              <p>Here you made the mistake of misunderstanding the purpose of Virtual Persona. It's not about creating virtual feelings or some kind of virtual partner. It's an assistant. Its purpose is to make you more time-efficient, disciplined, and much more, as discussed in the AIM section. Ultimately, it's about giving you more personal time so that you can go out, make new friends, talk to your friends, create real-world relationships, and get extra hours just for your family without worrying about your daily tasks and To-Do's. Alleviate that stress of work and spend some quality time with your loved ones.</p>

                <h3 class="fs-2">Less Distraction</h3>
                <p>In the modern world, there are so many social media apps to keep you continuously busy. They can shorten our attention span. There are many fake people who fake happiness and their identity, which mentally affects others. We get dozens of notifications every hour, urging us to reply immediately, no matter what we are doing. There is so much distraction out there that it feels normal, and even though everyone knows it affects our attention spans and thinking capabilities, it continues. This constant distraction fades our ability to work deeply, ultimately decreasing productivity. Without deep, focused work, it's very hard to concentrate all of our energy on one task and achieve the best results. It feels like a little external push to work will be good enough to keep ourselves motivated and beat procrastination. Nobody is free enough to manage our daily personal tasks. Virtual Persona gives you that push, keeping you on track and beating all these distractions because you and your tasks are its priority.</p>

                <h3 class="fs-2">More Personal Time</h3>
                <p>A Japanese company called Gatebox developed a 3D AI holographic character in a glass jar to provide virtual companionship. Some people felt less lonely, while others criticized it, saying society has become weak for preferring virtual entities over real partners. They have a point. Currently, about 20% of all teens experience depression before adulthood, and 10-15% suffer from symptoms at any given time. Virtual Persona aims to address this issue by helping people with their work. By making progress, those who feel depressed due to procrastination or lack of focus can find some relief. It may not solve the problem entirely, but it can help to some extent. With more time for family and friends, their mental health can improve. Virtual models will regularly encourage you to spend your free time with others and make real friends. They can create a positive aura around you, and you can discuss problems with them or share anything because they are not humans.

                <p>EThese days, social media feeds negatively influence youth, and industries are making it worse. The addictive nature of platforms like Instagram, combined with their constant stream of content, can impact mental health, particularly for teenagers. Spending excessive time on these platforms can lead to feelings of inadequacy, comparison, and reduced self-esteem. Virtual Persona, on the other hand, aims to help the world's youth get virtual support to prioritize their work, finish their daily tasks, and stay consistent and disciplined. It provides a virtual presence to ensure you do something valuable for yourself and your society. To make it as interactive as those social media apps, it works more like a live game designed to use your time efficiently instead of wasting it. The time you invest here is as valuable as the time you invest in yourself. It's not designed for industries to run ads or make money but to help ordinary people become extraordinary.</p>
